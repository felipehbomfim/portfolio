                         Hey, my name is Felipe Bomfim, living in Curitiba - Paran√°, Brazil. I love games and technology,  and that what motivated me to become a developer. I love what I do, and I expect to start develop full native mobile applications in a near future.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         I have more than 3 years of experience as full stack developer, developing ERPs, integrations, apis, support clients and among others. Always looking forward and studying new technologies. I already did some webviews, all by my self, since the full code, utiling html, css, php, etc to the final app, encapsulating and publishing on app store and play store. I started to develop a full native app for android, using Kotlin, learning a lot of concepts and things and recently I start studying flutter and react deeper.
                     </p>
